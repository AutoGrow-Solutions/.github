Welcome to the GitHub repository for AutoGrow, a student-led initiative aiming to revolutionize urban agriculture with cost-effective, AI-driven, fully automated hydroponic systems. Here, we share our developments, collaborate on updates, and document our progress in creating sustainable urban farming solutions accessible to everyone.

## About Us

OutGrow is born from a passion for sustainable agriculture and technology, initiated by students from [The IIE Varsity College Durban North]. Our mission is to make efficient farming accessible in urban settings where traditional farming faces challenges. Our solutions are designed to be user-friendly, resource-efficient, and scalable.

## Our Hydroponic Solution

Our hydroponic systems utilize cutting-edge AI technology to optimize resource use and boost crop yields with minimal human intervention. Here are the key features:

- **Cost-Effective**: Designed to be affordable for various economic backgrounds.
- **AI Optimization**: Smart monitoring of plant health, nutrients, and environmental conditions.
- **Fully Automated System**: Automated from seeding to harvesting with minimal manual input needed.
- **Educational Interface**: Features an app that not only controls the system but also educates users on hydroponic processes.
- **Sustainability**: Consumes 90% less water than conventional farming methods and is constructed from sustainable materials.
